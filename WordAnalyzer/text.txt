There are four official game modes: "osu!standard" (often just called "osu!"), "osu!taiko", "osu!catch" (formerly "osu!ctb"), and "osu!mania".[7][8] These are played with beatmaps, usually referred to as maps. For standard, maps consist of three items – hit circles, sliders, and spinners. These objects are arranged in different positions on the screen and in different points of time. Catch beatmaps have fruits and spinners, which are arranged in a horizontal manner. Mania beatmaps consist of keys (depicted as a small bar) and holds. The beatmap is then played with accompanying music, simulating a sense of rhythm as the player interacts with the objects to the beat of the music.[9][10] Each beatmap is accompanied by a background. The game can be played using various peripherals, but the most common are a graphics tablet or computer mouse to control cursor movement, paired with a keyboard.[11][4]All game modes also have certain mods which can be applied which altar the gameplay in some way. While each mode has its own unique mods, most are standard between game modes. These mods can be divided up into three categories: Difficulty increase (Hard Rock, Sudden Death/Perfect, Hidden/Fade In, Double Time/Nightcore, Flashlight), Difficulty decrease (Easy, Half Time, No-Fail, Spun Out, Relax, Auto-Pilot) and Unranked (Cinema, Auto, ScoreV2, Target Practice)
